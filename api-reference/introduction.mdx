# Dvuln API Documentation

The Dvuln API enables you to programmatically manage projects, issues, and comments within your organization's security operations. Build custom integrations, automate workflows, and extend Dvuln's capabilities to fit your needs.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://console.dvuln.com
```

## Authentication

The Dvuln API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Quick Start

### 1. Get your API key

Generate an API key from your Dvuln dashboard under **Settings â†’ API Keys**.

### 2. Make your first request

Test your authentication with the `/api/org/info` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET https://console.dvuln.com/api/org/info \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Explore the API

Use the interactive playground on each endpoint page to test requests directly from your browser.

## Core Resources

### Organizations
Manage organization settings and retrieve organization information.

### Projects
Create, update, and manage security projects within your organization.

### Issues
Track vulnerabilities, security findings, and remediation efforts.

### Comments
Add notes, updates, and collaborate on security issues.

## Response Format

All API responses return JSON with consistent formatting:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| 403 | Forbidden - Invalid API key |
| 404 | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |

Error responses include details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_API_KEY",
    "message": "The provided API key is invalid or expired"
  },
  "success": false
}
```

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure platform stability:
- **Default limit**: 1000 requests per hour
- **Burst limit**: 100 requests per minute

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per hour
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when limit resets
